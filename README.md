# TransPy
WIP!!! CURRENT STATE DOES NOT REPRESENT FINAL FORM AND SOME CODE MAY NOT WORK AS DESCRIBED, RUN AT YOUR OWN DISCRETION!!!


TransPy is a local Ai that will translate your Python File to C++ to run faster. This is not done yet but be patient.

Please use python 3.10
Works best with a discrete GPU preferably NVIDIA

To use run the .bin file in temp, make sure all dependancies are installed (primarliy torch and transformers)

WARNING: WILL NOT WORK WITH NORMAL CODE: ONLY MATHEMATICS

If you have any files that contain direct Python to C++ translations please let me know because the hardest challenge in developing this AI so far is a critical lack of data.
